                Hujur is the best person in the world I've ever seen. He is the international madrasa teacher who helps the students of madrasa to become Quran e-Hafez, he is the pioneer of many people's success. He is one of the qualified Hafez of higher levels in Bangladesh. Hazrat has always been renowned among us as a successful personality in his personal and Familial life. He is the only source of good character and generosity, the best ideal for every welfare work. I wish him a long life as a student of Hazrat.
